## 1. Problem
What real-world system is modeled? Why?

## 2. Model used
ODE / PDE / stochastic?
Key equations (in words, not full derivation)

## 3. Why math mattered
What insight did math give that experiments alone couldn’t?

## 4. Limitations
Assumptions, simplifications, missing dynamics

## 5. My question
What would I change, extend, or test differently?
