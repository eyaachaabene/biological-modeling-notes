# Mathematical Modeling of Complex Biological Systems
**Hans Peter Fischer (2008)**

## 1. Biological problem
Understanding complex biological systems (liver cells, signaling pathways)
beyond static molecular catalogs. Motivation: complex diseases require
system-level insight, not just gene lists.

## 2. Modeling framework
- Metabolic pathways: stoichiometric balance models (linear constraints)
- Signaling pathways: ODE / PDE dynamic models
- Stochastic models for low-copy-number molecules

Key idea:
dC/dt = production − consumption

Example:
NFκB / IκB negative feedback leading to oscillations.

## 3. Why mathematics mattered
- Revealed emergent behaviors (oscillations, amplification)
- Enabled parameter estimation from dynamic data
- Allowed systematic in-silico perturbations
- Identified rate-limiting steps in metabolic networks

## 4. Limitations
- Missing kinetic parameters
- Dependence on experimental data quality
- Multiscale challenges
- Neglect of molecular spatial structure
- Deterministic models ignore stochastic effects

## 5. My research question
How does alcohol-induced perturbation affect NFκB oscillatory dynamics?
- Does alcohol change oscillation frequency or damping?
- Can the model predict loss of inflammatory regulation?
